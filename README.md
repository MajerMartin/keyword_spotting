# Bachelor's Thesis - Keyword Spotting

Keyword spotting using multiple methods:

* Support vector machine with Dynamic time warping
* Feed-forward neural network with Dynamic time warping
* Feed-forward neural network with bottleneck layer

Tested on log filterbank energies and MFCC both with and without delta/delta-delta coefficients.

Developed in Python 2.7 with scikit-learn and Lasagne.
